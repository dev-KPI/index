# tr-14 dev. community
## About
Our main goal is to create a dev. community for better studying experience around programming. That means that as member of community you agree with following of the the following **rules**:
1. You should be non-toxic.
2. You *must* be active, that means that as a part of community you should take part in community's life: reviewing code of your colleagues, adding new code to your personal folder, e.t.c..
3. You shouldn't be shy. In case you need help, just ask.
4. You *mustn't* cheat! That means that you also agree with [Academic Integrity](https://kpi.ua/academic-integrity) rules.
5. Your opinion matters.
6. There're no bosses here, all have same rights for reviews, voatings, providing events.
7. Respect your colleagues.
## Useful for newbies
### What to begin with? 
1. You should work in your own directory under specific subject, for exemple "university/<subject>/<first-letter-of-your-name-surename>";
1.1 If you don't have that, ping some one of tg chat admins and wait. 
2. You have freedom of working in dev branch of every your folder, but try to follow the structure and create files with easy to understand names, but names of folders must be typed in kebab-case.  

    | Good structure ✅ | Bad structure ❌ | Correct exemple |
    |:-----------------|:------------------|:----------------:|
    | Readable | Hard to read | 01-lab-arrays |
    | Easy to orient | Messed | nsurename/lab/solution.js |
    | Scalable | Hasn't root | modules - src - e.t.c. |
    | Typed only in eng | "Бутерброт" | nsurename/lab/solution.js |    
3. Remember that you must work with your "dev" branch, when you suddenly want to merge dev with master it means that your task is stable, create pull req and wait for review, it takes some time. Be thankful for review.
4. If you haven't understood smth check git tutorials.
5. Your changes will be merged only after 2 reviews. It doesn't matter if admin wrote that everything is okay, 2 is 2.
6. Have fun!
